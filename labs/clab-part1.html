<h2> Lab 1 (clab-part1): Basic C Programming</h2>

<p>
Before you start Lab 1, make sure you've done the <a href="index.html">lab environment setup</a>.

<p>In this lab, you will get hands dirty doing some basic C programming and
debugging.   The lab asks you to write several simple C functions in programs
whose skeleton code are already provided for you. 

<p>
<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
	<h5>Programming style:</h5>
	<p>For style, please read this <a href="https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2025/Style/">style guide</a> and follow the advice.
</div>

<p> First, click on Lab1's github classroom invitation link (posted in Campuswire) and select your NYU NetID.  Next, clone your repo by typing the following
<pre>
$ cd cso-labs
$ git clone git@github.com:nyu-cso-sp26/clab-part1-&lt;YourGithubUsername&gt;.git lab1
</pre>


<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-danger"><h5>File modification</h5> For this lab,
the only files that you should modify are <tt>bitfloat.c</tt>, <tt>ptr.c</tt> and <tt>array.c</tt>.
You may read other files but you must not change them.</tt></span>.
</div>

<p>
Complete the exercises in files <tt>bitfloat.c</tt>, <tt>ptr.c</tt>, <tt>array.c</tt>, in order. It is recommended that you complete and test the exercises in each file individually before moving on to the next. For example, suppose you have completed the exercise in <tt>bitfloat.c</tt>.  You can test by first launching the lab's docker container (see instructions <a href="https://nyu-cso.github.io/labs/index.html#start">here</a>).  Once you a prompt like <gbd>student@3694b47269f3:/cso-labs$</a>, you know you are inside the running container.  Test by typing the following:
<pre >
student@3694b47269f3:/cso-labs$ make
student@3694b47269f3:/cso-labs$ ./clab_test
Bit at pos 0 of int 1 should be 1 (returned 23)
---Start testing bitfloat.c
      get_bit_at_pos...
Aborted (core dumped)
</pre>

From the above error message, you can see that my implementation of <tt>get_bit_at_pos</tt> in bitfloat.c did not pass the test. Debug and try again.
Complete and test each part individually before moving on to the next one.

<p>Once you've passed all the tests, you should see this (note that <tt>get_precision</tt> is a bonus problem):
<pre >
student@3694b47269f3:/cso-labs$ ./clab_test
---Start testing bitfloat.c
      get_bit_at_pos...passed
      flip_bit_at_pos...passed
      get_most_significant_byte...passed
      sum_overflowed...passed
      get_exponent_field...passed
      get_precision...passed 
---Test bitfloat.c Passed
---Start testing ptr.c
      set_to_five...passed
      initialize_ptr...passed
      swap_int...passed
---Test ptr.c Passed
---Start testing array.c
      array_sum...passed
      array_cpy...passed
      bubble_sort...passed
      big_to_little_endian...passed
---Test array.c Passed
</pre>

<p>

<h4>Saving changes while you are working on Lab1</h4>
You should frequently save your 
work to protect against laptop failures and other unforeseen troubles. 
You save the changes by first "committing" them to your local lab repo and then "pushing" 
those changes to the repo stored on github.com
<p>
<pre >
$ git commit -am "saving lab1 changes"
$ git push origin master
</pre>

<p>The `-a` flag (as in the command `git commit -am ...`) tells git to add the changes you've made to existing files to the current commit.
If you do not provide this flag, the changes you made to the existing files will not be committed.
After you've pushed your changes with <kbd>git push</kbd>, they are safely stored on github.com.
Even if your laptop catches on fire in the future, those pushed changes can still be retrieved.
However, you must remember that <kbd>git commit</kbd> by itself does not save your changes on github.com 
(it only saves your changes locally).  So, don't forget to type that <kbd>git
  push origin master</kbd>.

<p>
<h4 id="debug">Debugging the lab</h4>

Below are some advice on how to debug common problems encountered in doing this lab:

<ul>
	<li><b>Remember to recompile changed code</b>. Whenever you've changed a file, always type <kbd>make</kbd> to re-compile before executing again.</li>

  <li><b>Read the test code in <tt>clab_test.c</tt></b>. You have to understand what kind of tests are being conducted in order to debug your code.</li>
		<li><b>Learn to use <tt>gdb</tt></b>.  It is absolutely essential that you learn to use <tt>gdb</tt>. This tool is a must for helping you handle ``segmentation fault'',
		which you'll see a lot when doing labs.  Let's say you encounter "core dumped" when testing. Invoke <tt>gdb</tt> by typing:
		<p>
<pre >
$ gdb clab_test
(gdb) bt
</pre>
<tt>bt</tt> is the gdb command to print the stack trace which tells you where the problematic execution occurs and how the program got there.
Here is a basic <a href="gdb.html">GDB tutorial</a> that you should go through by yourself.
</ul>
 
<h4>Handin Procedure</h4>

Follow these <a href="index.html#handin">instructions</a>.

<h4>Grading</h4>
<p>If your program passes all the tests included in <tt>clab_test.c</tt> files, you'll receive the full mark.  However, the lab mark is a only small fraction of the final grade, we'll evaluate your actual understanding of the lab in a corresponding in-person test.
