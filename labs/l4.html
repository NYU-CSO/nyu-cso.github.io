<h2> Lab-4: Malloc lab</h2>


<a name="labs">
<h3>Introduction</h3>

In this lab you will be writing a dynamic storage allocator for C
programs, i.e., your own version of the <tt>malloc</tt>, <tt> free</tt> and
<tt>realloc</tt> routines. You are encouraged to explore the design space
creatively and implement an allocator that is correct, efficient and
fast.

<p> This is an individual lab. </p>

<h3>Obtaining the lab</h3>
<p> First, click on Lab4's github classroom invitation link (posted on Campuswire) and select your NYU NetID.  Next, clone your repo by typing the following
<pre >
$ cd cso-labs
$ git clone git@github.com:nyu-cso-fa21/lab4-&lt;YourGithubUsername&gt;.git  lab4
</pre>

<p>
This lab's files are 
located in the <tt>lab4/</tt> subdirectory.  <div class="bd-callout bd-callout-warning">
	<h5>Files you can modify</h5>
	<p>The only files you should modify for this lab are <tt>mm-implicit.c</tt>. If you are 
  doing the bonus part of this lab, you'll also modify <tt>mm.c</tt>, <tt>mm.h</tt>, <tt>mm-unittest.c</tt>. 
<ul>
</div>

<h3>Malloc API</h3>

The API of your malloc library consists of the following 5 functions (declared in <tt>mm-common.h</tt>:
<pre>
int    mm_init(void);
void*  mm_malloc(size_t size);
void   mm_free(void *ptr);
void*  mm_realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);
heap_info_t mm_checkheap(bool verbose);
</pre>

Your malloc implementation must complete the above 5 functions.  Note that we
use the prefix <tt>mm_*</tt> in the above APIs to distinguish your
implementation from those come with the standard C library.  The API semantics
are as follows:

<ul>
	<li><p><tt>mm_init</tt>: This function is called to initialize your malloc library prior to any 
  any <tt>mm_malloc</tt> and <tt>mm_free</tt> calls. 
  In this lab, the given tester programs (<tt>mm_unittest.c</tt>, <tt>mdriver.c</tt>) 
  invoke <tt>mm_init</tt>.  The return value is -1 if there was a problem in
performing the initialization, 0 otherwise.
  
<li><p><tt>mm_malloc</tt>: This function allocates <tt>size</tt> bytes of contiguous space on the heap.  It returns a pointer to the allocated space.
  The allocated space should lie within the heap region and should not
	overlap with any other allocated space.

<p>We will comparing your implementation to the version of <tt>malloc</tt>
supplied in the standard C library. Since the 
standard C library malloc always returns payload pointers that are 
aligned to 16 bytes, your malloc implementation should do likewise
and always return 16-byte aligned pointers.
  
<li><p><tt>mm_free</tt>: This function frees the corresponding chunk whose payload 
is pointed to by <tt>ptr</tt>.  It returns nothing. This function assumes that
the pointer <tt>ptr</tt> was returned by an earlier call to <tt>mm_malloc</tt>
or <tt>mm_realloc</tt> and has not yet been freed.

<li><p><tt>mm_realloc</tt>: This function allocates 
<tt>size</tt> bytes of contiguious space, with the following 
constraints. 

<ul>
	<li>if <tt>ptr</tt> is NULL, the call is equivalent to <tt>mm_malloc(size)</tt>

	<li>if <tt>size</tt> is equal to zero, the call is equivalent to <tt>mm_free(ptr)}</tt>;

	<li> if <tt>ptr</tt> is not NULL, it must have been returned by an
       	earlier call to <tt>mm_malloc</tt> or <tt>mm_realloc</tt>. The call to
	<tt>mm_realloc</tt> changes the memory block pointed to by
	<tt>ptr</tt> (i.e.the old block) to one with <tt>size</tt> bytes and returns the
	address of the new block. Notice that the address of the new block
	might be the same as the old block, or it might be different,
	depending on your implementation, the amount of internal fragmentation
	in the old block, and the size of the <tt>realloc</tt> request.

	<li> The contents of the new block are the same as those of the old
	<tt>ptr</tt> block, up to the minimum of the old and new sizes (the new size 
  can be either smaller or larger than the old size).
	Everything else is uninitialized. For example, if the old block is 8
	bytes and the new block is 12 bytes, then the first 8 bytes of the new
	block are identical to the first 8 bytes of the old block and the last
	4 bytes are uninitialized.  Similarly, if the old block is 8 bytes and
	the new block is 4 bytes, then the contents of the new block are
	identical to the first 4 bytes of the old block.  
</ul> 

<li><p>Lastly, <tt>mm_checkheap</tt>: The <tt>mm_cheapheap</tt> routine is an 
auxilary routine that checks <a href="#heapconsistency">the consistency of 
	your heap</a>. The function argument <tt>verbose</tt> can be used to 
turn on/off verbose debug printing.
</ul>

<p>The mm_malloc, mm_free, mm_realloc semantics match those of the C standard
library's malloc, realloc, and free routines.  Type <tt>man malloc</tt> for the
complete documentation.


<p>When implementing <tt>mm_init</tt>, <tt>mm_free</tt>,
<tt>mm_malloc</tt><tt>mm_realloc</tt> functions, you need to invoke the
following functions which emulate the OS' syscalls, instead of using the real ones (in order to 
make testing easier).  These emulated syscalls are defined in <tt>memlib.c</tt> and described below:

<ul>
	<li><p><tt> void *mem_sbrk(int incr)</tt>:   
Expands the heap by incr bytes, where incr is a positive
non-zero integer and returns a generic pointer to the first byte of
the newly allocated heap area. The semantics are identical to the Unix
<tt>sbrk</tt> function, except that <tt>mem_sbrk</tt> accepts only a
positive non-zero integer argument.

<li><p><tt> void *mem_heap_lo(void)</tt>:
Returns a generic pointer to the first byte in the heap.

<li><p><tt> void *mem_heap_hi(void)</tt>:
Returns a generic pointer to the last byte in the heap.

<li><p><tt> size_t mem_heapsize(void)</tt>:
Returns the current size of the heap in bytes.

<li><p><tt> size_t mem_pagesize(void)</tt>:
Returns the system's page size in bytes 
</ul>

<p> Your implementation must observe the following rules:
<ul>
<li> You should not invoke any memory-management related library
calls or system calls, i.e. you <b>cannot</b> use malloc, calloc, free, realloc, sbrk,
brk or any variants of these calls in your code. You <b>may</b> use 
memcpy and other C library functions that are not related to memory-management. In case of 
doubt, please check with the staff on Campuswire.

<li> 
You should not use any dynamically sized data
structures such as dynamically-sized arrays, trees, or lists in your 
program.  Yes, you can define a global array of a fixed number of elements 
of structs, pointers or other scalars. 

<li>
For consistency with the C standard library's malloc package, which
returns blocks aligned on 16-byte boundaries, your allocator must
always return pointers that are aligned to 16-byte boundaries.  The
tester will enforce this requirement for you.
</ul>


<h3 id="implicitlist">Implement implicit list malloc</h3>
You are asked to implement an existing simple design, i.e. the
implicit list based malloc (without footer).

<p>To implement implicit-list, you shall work from the skeleton 
code given to you in <tt>mm-implicit.{c,h}</tt>. You should only
modify <tt>mm-implicit.c</tt> while leaving <tt>mm-implicit.h</tt> unchanged.

<p>In <tt>mm-implicit.h</tt>, we give you the definition of chunk header in 
the implicit list design.  For simplicity, we make the header (16-byte)
aligned.  Unlike the header discussed in the lecture, we will simplify it 
further and use an 8-byte integer (<tt>size_t</tt>) to store the chunk
size (including chunk header) and another 8-byte integer to store the status on
whether the chunk is allocated or free. Since our implementation frequently
refers to the size of the header, we set global variable <tt>hdr_size =
sizeof(header_t)</tt>, and use <tt>hdr_size</tt> later in the code.
We don't have a footer in the chunk, so coalescing is only done with the next
but not the previous free chunk.

<p>You shall complete the implicit list implementation in the following 3 steps:
<ol>
	<li> Complete helper function <tt>next_chunk</tt> and use it to complete the heap checker function <tt>mm_heapcheck</tt>. You can test these two functions by compiling <kbd>make</kbd> and running the unit test <kbd>./implicit-unittest</kbd>. The unit test should finish its first 2 tests, <tt>test_next_chunk</tt> and <tt>test_mm_checkheap</tt> and fails at the 3rd test (since you've not implemented the rest yet). Please read the unit test file <tt>mm-implicit-unittest.c</tt> to understand what the unit test is doing.
	<li>Complete helper functions <tt>ask_os_for_chunk</tt>, <tt>split</tt>, <tt>first_fit</tt> and use them to implement <tt>mm_malloc</tt>.  Perform unit test on your implementation.
	<li>Complete helper functions <tt>payload2header</tt>, <tt>coalesce</tt> and use them to implement <tt>mm_free</tt>.
</ol>

<p>After you've completed your implemementation, make sure that all unit tests pass.
<pre>
$ make
$ ./implicit-unittest
start test_next_chunk
start test_mm_checkheap
start test_ask_os_for_chunk
start test_split
start test_first_fit
start test_mm_malloc
start test_payload2header
start test_coalesce
start test_mm_free
start test_mm_realloc
all unit tests passed...
</pre>

<p>Now you are ready to run our trace-based tester.
The tester program is provided as <tt> mdriver.c</tt> which is linked to your
malloc implementation and tests it for correctness, space utilization, and
throughput. We name the tester that's been linked with the
implicit-list malloc as <tt>implicit-mdriver</tt>.

<p>The tester <tt>implicit-mdriver</tt> reads a set of <i>trace files</i>, each of which
contains a sequence of allocate, reallocate, and free events corresponding
to some example application workload.  It then </tt> calls your
<tt>mm_malloc</tt>, <tt>mm_realloc</tt>, and <tt>mm_free</tt> routines
according to the sequence of events. 

<p>To run the tester, type:
<pre>
$ ./implicit-mdriver -V
</pre>

<p>The <tt>-V</tt> turns on verbose printing in the tester. 

<p>To run the tester on one specific tracefile instead of all of the default tracefiles, type:
<pre>
$./implicit-mdriver -V -f tracefile
</pre>

<p>All the tracefiles can be found in the <tt>traces/</tt> subdirectory.

<p>You can type <tt>$./implicit-mdriver -h</tt> to 
see a full list of command line options. 

Here's the example output if the tester runs successfully.
<pre>
$ ./implicit-mdriver
Using default tracefiles in ./traces/
Performance index = 60.0 * util + 40.0 * (your throughput)/(libc's throughput)
11 out of 11 traces passed, average performance index 48.4 (out of 100.0)
</pre>

You can refer to <a href="l4.html#eval">here</a> to understand how the performance 
index is calculated.  As we expect, the implicit list design works but does not
achieve great performance.

<h3> Bonus part: Implement your own malloc</h3>

<p> For extra challenge after finishing implicit-list malloc, you can implement
your own malloc design, or do a variation of one of the designs taught in the lecture. 
For example, you can implement explicit-list, segregated
explict-list, buddy system, or invent your own! 

<p>You are supposed to modify only these files: <tt>mm.c</tt> <tt>mm.h</tt>
<tt>mm-unittest.c</tt>. This time, we no longer provide the unit test
implementation nor any skeleton code. You should write your own unit test  (<tt>mm-unittest.c</tt>)
in the style of <tt>mm-implicit-unittest.c</tt> to test the correctness of 
your implementation in <tt>mm.c</tt>. The given makefile compiles your unit test <tt>mm-unittest.c</tt> into binary executable <tt>unittest</tt> which you can invoke.

<p>Once you finish the implementation, invoke the trace-based tester as follows:
<pre>
$ ./mdriver -V
</pre>

<h3>Programming Advice</h3>

<ul>

	<li>Your code should have a header comment that describes the
overall design of your malloc implementation: e.g. the organization of the
free list.  Each function should also have a header comment that describes what
the function does.

	<li> Define your chunk header as structs and modularize your implementation 
using helper functions. The skeleton code of <tt>mm-implicit.c</tt>
gives you an example of modular implementation. Follow it.
While Bryant/O'Hallaron's textbook is useful for reviewing the malloc design, <b>I do not
recommend follow the textbook programming style</b> of doing pointer
arithmetic everywhere and using C macros instead of regular functions.  It
makes the code harder to read and debug. Define structs to represent chunk
meta-data and use regular helper functions, as demonstrated in
<tt>mm-implicit.c</tt>

<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-warning">
	<h5 id="heapconsistency">Heap consistency checker:</h5>
<p> Your heap consistency checker <tt>mm_checkheap</tt> should be
thorough. Some examples of what a heap checker might check are:
<ul>
<li> Is every block in the free list marked as free?
<li> If you are coalescing with both previous and next free chunk, there should not be any contiguous free blocks. Is this property always true?
<li> Is every free block in the free list?
<li> Do the pointers in the free list point to valid free blocks?
<li> Do any allocated blocks overlap?
<li> Do the pointers in a heap block point to valid heap
addresses?
</ul>
</div>

	<li>Write unit tests (in <tt>mm-unittest.c</tt>) in the style of
<tt>mm-implicit-unittest.c</tt>. They might seem tedious, but they are crucial 
for debugging. 

	<li>When testing with trace-based tester, use simple workloads first to debug correctness. 
We provide two very simple trace files <tt>short{1,2}.rep</tt> to simplify debugging.
Type <tt>mdriver -f ./traces/short1.rep</tt> to test your memory allocator on 
one of these workloads first.

	<li>The first 9 traces
contain requests to <tt>malloc</tt> and <tt>free</tt>.  The last 2 traces
contain requests for <tt>realloc</tt>, <tt>malloc</tt>, and <tt>free</tt>. We
recommend that you start by getting your <tt>malloc</tt> and <tt>free</tt>
routines working correctly and efficiently on the first 9 traces. Only
then should you turn your attention to the <tt>realloc</tt>
implementation.  For starters, build <tt>mm_realloc</tt> on top of your
existing <tt>mm_malloc</tt> and <tt>mm_free</tt> implementations. But to get
really good performance, you will need to build a stand-alone <tt>
mm_realloc</tt>.

	<li>Use gdb. It
will help you isolate and identify out of bounds memory references.

	<li>For advanced students, you should consider learning to use a profiler, 
such as <tt>gprof</tt>, to understand and optimize the performance of your program. 

</ul>

<h3 id="eval">Evaluation</h3>

<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-warning">
	<h5>Programming style:</h5>
    <p>As is the case with previous labs, we reserve the right to critique your coding style and we
    will deduct up to 20% of total lab points for bad style based on our
    subjective evaluation.
</div>

<p>You will receive <b>zero points</b> if you break any of the rules or
your code is buggy and crashes the tester.  Otherwise, your grade will
be calculated as follows:

<ul>
	<li><p><b>Correctness of implicit-list (50 points)</b>.
To achieve full score, your implicit list implementation must pass both the 
unit test <tt>implicit-unittest</tt> and trace-based test <tt>implicit-mdriver</tt>.

<li><p><b>Performance of your malloc (50 points)</b>.  
Two performance metrics will be used to evaluate your solution:

<ul>
	<li><p>Space utilization: The peak ratio between the aggregate
amount of memory used by the tester (i.e., allocated via
<tt>mm_malloc</tt> or <tt>mm_realloc</tt> but not yet freed via
<tt>mm_free</tt>) and the size of the heap used by your allocator. The
optimal ratio equals to 1.  You should find good policies to minimize
fragmentation in order to make this ratio as close as possible to the
optimal.

<li><p>Throughput: The average number of operations completed per second.

</ul>
<p>The tester program summarizes the performance of your
allocator by computing a <i>performance index</i>, which is a
weighted sum of the space utilization (U) and throughput (T)
<pre>
Performance index = 0.6*U + 0.4*min(1, T/T_libc)
</pre>

where U is your space utilization, T is your throughput, and
T_libc is the measured throughput of Standard C library's malloc on your
system on the default traces. Throughput is calculated as the number of 
requests in a given trace divided by how long it takes 
a malloc library to process all those requests.
</ul>

<p>Observing that both memory and CPU cycles are expensive system
resources, we adopt this formula to encourage balanced optimization of
both memory utilization and throughput.  To receive a good score,
you must achieve a balance between utilization and throughput.
Ideally, the performance
index could reach 100%, but that is very difficult.
