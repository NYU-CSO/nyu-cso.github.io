<h4 id="login">Log into CIMS servers from your laptop</h4>

<h5>Windows laptop:</h5>

<p>You should use the Chrome secure shell extension to log into Courant servers.</p>

<p>Make sure you have <a href="https://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome browser</a> installed.</p>

<p>Download and install <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/iodihamcpbpeioajjeobimgagajmlibd?hl=en">Chrome secure shell extension</a> </p>

<p>Launch Chrome, then open the extension by clicking the extension icon, 
	followed by clicking "Connection Dialog". </p>
<p><img src="chrome_ext.png" width=500></img></p>
<p><img src="chrome_ext_ssh.png" width=500></img></p>

<p></p>

<p>You should do the labs on Courant's Compute Server called 
	<tt>snappy1.cims.nyu.edu</tt>. 
	To log in snappy1, you must go through a gateway host called 
	<tt>access.cims.nyu.edu</tt> first by 
	filling in the following information after opening the secure shell extension. 
	Note: Substitute <tt>your-cims-username</tt> with your Courant computer account username.</p>
	
<p><img src="ssh_access_cims.png" width=500></img></p>

<p>After you have logged into <tt>access.cims.nyu.edu</tt>. Type in the following command to log into snappy1.cims.nyu.edu</p>
<pre>access$ ssh snappy1</pre></p>

<h5>Mac Laptop:</h5>

<p>You can use the native Mac terminal to log into Courant servers.</p>

<p>Launch a Mac terminal</p>

<p>Log into the Courant gateway host by typing the command <tt>$ ssh access.cims.nyu.edu</tt></p>

<p>Continue on logging into snappy1 by typing <pre>access$ ssh snappy1</pre></p>

<h5>Using commandline</h5>
Once you've logged into snappy1, you'll need to use UNIX commands to navigate the file systems, launch programs, editors and so forth. Getting familiar with the UNIX commandline is an indispencible skill for any CS student. You can learn more about command line <a href="https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line">here</a>.  You may also find this one-page <a href="linux_cheat_sheet">cheatcheet</a> handy.

<p>

<h4 id="repo">Setting up Git Repository</h4>
<p>For each student in the class, we have created for him/her a corresponding private
lab repository on Github.com. You will submit labs by pushing to your private
repo on github.com (as many times as you want) and then submitting them via Gradescope.

<p>
Below are the steps
for setting up your the lab environment on <tt>snappy1</tt>.  If you are not
familiar with the <tt>git</tt> version control system,  follow the resources <a
href="https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/">here</a>
to get started.

<p><b>Preparation: set up ssh-based logins to github</b>.  This is needed as github no longer accepts password-based commandlines.
<ul>
  <li>On snappy1, generate a pair of ssh keys by typing:
    <pre>
    snappy1$ ssh-keygen
    </pre>
    <p>Hit [Enter] a couple of times until you see that the keys have been saved in the files, like the example below</p>
      <p><img src="ssh-keygen.png" width=600></img></p>
  </li>
  <li>Display the contents of the public key portion of the key pair by typing the following. You'll need to copy-n-paste this content to github website</p>
      <pre>
      snappy1$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
      </pre>
    <img src="ssh-pub.png" width=800></img></p>

  </li>
  <li>Enter public key information in github.  To do so, use the browser on your laptop to log into <a href="https://github.com">github website</a>.  Click the icon on the top right corner to pull down a menu, then click "Settings".  On the settings page, click "SSH and GPG keys" on the left-side menu, then click the green button named "New SSH key".  Type <tt>snappy1</tt> in the textbox named "Title".  Copy-n-paste the content of your previously generated public key to the textbox named "Key". Then, click "Add SSH key".

      <p><img src="github-ssh.png" width=900></img></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p> <b>Cloning your lab repo on snappy1</b>
<p>
	<li> Create a github private repository by clicking on each lab's invitation link (posted in Campuswire).  Select your NYU NetID to link your github account and create your lab repository on Github.
  </li>

  <p>
  <li>On snappy1, we recommend you create a directory to hold all your cloned lab repositories. 
  <pre>
  snappy1$ mkdir cso-labs
  </pre>
  </li>

  <li> On snapy1, clone your repo by typing the following (the following example is for the first lab).
    <pre >
snappy1$ cd cso-labs
snappy1$ git clone git@github.com:nyu-cso-fa21/clab-part1-&lt;YourGithubUsername&gt;.git clab-part1
    </pre>
    <p>
    You will see that a directory named <tt>lab1</tt> has been created under the <tt>cso-labs</tt> directory.
    This is the git repo for your lab assignment 1. Other labs can be created similarly by cloning respective repositories.
  </li>

</ul>

<!--
<li><b>Setting up the upstream repo</b>
		<p>The lab skeleton code are kept in the repo <a
      href="https://github.com/nyu-cso/cso-labs"><tt>https://github.com/nyu-cso-fa19/cso-labs</tt></a>
managed by the course staff. Therefore, the first thing you need to do is to
set up your own lab repo to track the changes made in the <tt>cso-labs</tt> repo.
In the git world, <tt>cso-labs</tt> would be your "upstream" repo from which changes 
should ``flow'' into your own lab repo.

<p>Type <kbd>git remote add</kbd> to add the upstream repo, and <kbd>git remote -v</kbd> to check that <tt>cso-labs</tt> is indeed an upstream for your own lab repo.
<pre >
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/nyu-cso-fa19/cso-labs.git
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/nyu-cso-fa19/labs-YourGithubUsername.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/nyu-cso-fa19/labs-YourGithubUsername.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/nyu-cso-fa19/cso-labs.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/nyu-cso-fa19/cso-labs.git (push)
</pre>

<p>Immediately, you should check if the upstream cso-labs repo has additional changes not present in your repo. You can check for and merge in those changes by typing:
<pre >
$ git pull upstream master
</pre>
You should perform the above two steps periodically to ensure that you've got the latest lab code. 
We will also remind you to fetch upstream on Piazza if we make changes/bug-fixes to the labs.
</li>
-->

<p><b>Using a command line editor to modify files for your lab assignments</b>. 

<p>We recommend using <tt>nano</tt></b>. For example, if you want to change file <tt>array.c</tt>, type the following:
<pre>
	snappy1$ cd cso-labs/clab-part1
	snappy1$ nano array.c
</pre>

<p><b>Saving changes to Github while you are working on Labs</b>
<p>
As you modify the skeleton files to complete the labs, you should frequently save your 
work to protect against laptop failures and other unforeseen troubles. 
You save the changes by first "committing" them to your local lab repo and then "pushing" 
those changes to the repo stored on github.com
<pre >
$ git commit -am "saving my changes"
$ git push origin master
</pre>

Note that whenever you add a new file, you need to manually tell git to ``track it''.
Otherwise, the file will not be committed by git commit. Make git track a new file by typing:
<pre >
$ git add &lt;my-new-file&gt;
</pre>

<p>After you've pushed your changes by typing <kbd>git push origin master</kbd>, they are safely stored on github.com.
Even if your laptop catches on fire in the future, those pushed changes can still be retrieved.
However, you must remember that doing <kbd>git commit</kbd> by itself does not save your changes on github.com 
(it only saves your changes locally).  So, don't forget to type <kbd>git push origin master</kbd>.

<p>
To see if your local repo is up-to-date with your origin repo on github.com and vice versa, type
<kbd>git status</kbd>

<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
<h5 id="git-faq">FAQs on Git repository</h5>
<ul>
	<li><b>What message should I fill in for <kbd>git commit -am "message"</kbd></b>
		<p>The <tt>"message"</tt> can be any string. But we ask you to leave something descriptive as message. In the future, when you check your git logs, this message helps you recall what you did for this commit. We (CSO staff) will never read your commit message. It's not going to affect grading.
	</li>
 
	<li><b>How can I change a message if it's already pushed to GitHub?</b>
		<p>You don't need to change a message. There are ways to change messages but for CSO you never need them. Don't do it. It's going to cause conflict. <font color="red">Super dangerous.</font>
	</li>
 
	<li>I got an error message <tt>Fatal: Not a git repository</tt> (or any of the parent directories).</b>
	<p> This means you are typing git commands outside the directory containing your git repository. You need to type <kbd>cd recitations-XXX</kbd>, where XXX is your GitHub username.
	Remember to always type most git commands inside git repository. Commands like <kbd>git clone</kbd>, <kbd>git config --global</kbd> can be issued anywhere.
	</li>
 
	<li><b>Can I edit files through GitHub.com?</b>
		<p>No. You should <b>never</b> do that. That's very likely to cause conflicts. <font color="red"> Super dangerous.</font>
Please only use GitHub.com for read-only access, i.e. checking if all your changes have been pushed to your remote repository.
	</li>
 
	<li><b>When I do <tt>git pull</tt>, I got an error <tt>Repository not found</tt>.</b>
Check the repository address, there should be no quotes (") or angle brackets (&lt; &gt;). The lab instructions use quotes or angle brackets to mark a placeholder for your GitHub username.
If <tt>git pull upstream master</tt> fails, then check upstream address by typing
<kbd>git remote -v</kbd>
    To edit your upstream address, remove it first by typing
    <kbd>git remote remove upstream</kbd>, and then add it back with <kbd>git remote add</kbd>
</div>

<h4 id="handin">Handin Procedure</h4>

You must do <b>both</b> of the following steps:
<ul>
<li>
First, commit and push all your code changes to github.com by doing:
<pre >
$ git commit -am "finish lab"
$ git push origin master
</pre>

<li>
Next, submit your lab via Gradescope.  Log into Gradescope using your NYU email (the email containing your NYU id). Follow the instructions to submit your lab.
</ul>
